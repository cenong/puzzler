## Introduction
Puzzler is a memory testing VR application. The game requires the player to repeat the sequence of orbs highlighted in a random order.

I enjoyed the process involved in creating this VR application. I gained a profound understanding of the skills and time required to produce a relatively simple game. These skills include: 
- scene sketching
- 3D model building (SketchUp)
- VR object scaling (Unity and Google Cardboard)
- mood setting with lighting and audio (Unity and Google Cardboard)
- UI design sketching
- user testing

Most importantly, I learnt that going in early and often is the most efficient technique to discover and resolve issues. The following sections display the final results of the project, explain the design process, illustrate different components of the game, provide conclusions and explore future improvements. 
 
## Results

The game starts with a panel which explains the task that lies ahead for the player.

Upon clicking on the start button, the player enters a dimly lit room to solve the puzzle.

The image below is a link to a video recording of the VR experience on an iPhone. The video shows two rounds of the game:
- First round shows the gameplay when the player is successful on his/her first try
- Second round shows the gameplay when the player is initially unsuccessful

## Design Process

It is important to understand the target audience when you are designing a game. A useful technique for reflecting on and figuring out the target audience for your application is to create a persona. When creating a persona, I tried to answer the following questions:
- What motivates them?
- What is their experience with VR?
- How old are they?
- What do they do for work?

### Persona

For the puzzler game, I envisioned fun-loving undergraduate students, with a passion for puzzle games. The snippet below is a sample of a potential persona:

**Jonah**, 19, Undergraduate student

>I am a geek at heart. I love a creative, challenging game.

Jonah is a single, male undergraduate student who loves solving puzzles in his free time. He enjoys music and art, so he likes challenging creative games.
**VR experience**: Beginner
