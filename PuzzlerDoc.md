## Introduction
Puzzler is a memory testing VR application. The game requires the player to repeat the sequence of orbs highlighted in a random order.

I enjoyed the process involved in creating this VR application. I gained a profound understanding of the skills and time required to produce a relatively simple game. These skills include: 
- scene sketching
- 3D model building (SketchUp)
- VR object scaling (Unity and Google Cardboard)
- mood setting with lighting and audio (Unity and Google Cardboard)
- UI design sketching
- user testing

Most importantly, I learnt that going in early and often is the most efficient technique to discover and resolve issues.
